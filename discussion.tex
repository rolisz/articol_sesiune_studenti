\section{Discussion and comparison to related work}

This section analyzes our approaches and compares them to similar existing work.

\subsection{Analysis of the proposed approach}
For the character recognition problem, the best results obtained by both the linear SVM and the RBF SVM are very similar, the difference between their average scores being a bit more then 0.5\%. 

One explanation for this would be that the data is already high dimensional (400 dimensions) and the data points lie in sufficiently different parts so that the separating hyperplanes work effectively, without needing a projection into the infinite dimensional space offered by the RBF kernel.
