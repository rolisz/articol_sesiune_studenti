\section{Methodology}
This section presents the background of the machine learning approaches used in the problem of OCR and then the specifics of the models applied to this problem are discussed. 
\subsection{Theoretical background}
\subsubsection{Random forests}
Random forests have been introduced by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler\cite{breiman2001random} as an ensemble of decision trees. When using only one decision tree to make a classification, one often runs into problems with high variance or high bias. Random forests present a mechanism to avoid these problems to make more accurate models, that generalize better. 

When training the random forest, for each tree, n samples are taken with replacement from the training data (a bootstrap sample) 
\subsubsection{Linear SVM}
\subsection{Model design}
