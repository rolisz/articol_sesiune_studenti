\section{Figures}
Note that \verb|\label| must occur AFTER (or within) \verb|\caption|. For figures, \verb|\caption| should occur after the \verb|\includegraphics|. Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that is designed to preserve the operation of \verb|\label| within\verb| \caption| even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your \verb|\label| just after \verb|\caption| rather than within \verb|\caption{}|.
